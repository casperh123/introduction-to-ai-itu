Page 8 slides.
These things should be known.

Slide 15, 16, 27
Best-first search.
Greedy-best first search.
Heuristic theory.

## Adverserial search
Game tree.
Alpha-Beta-Search.
Monte Carlo Tree Search.

## Markov decision
Slide 6,
Stochastic actions.
Be able to solve a markov decision problem and process, Deterministic, nondeterministic? Should know the fundementals.
Value iteration.
Bellman Equation.

## Propsitional logic
Entailment and inference.
Learn the algorithms.

AC-3
Backtracking


## Local Search
Learn the algorithms
Why is this a good search algorithm
Maybe do  a local seach algorithm
Know name, know how they work.
What is the advangtage of the genetic algorithms?
